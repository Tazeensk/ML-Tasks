This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project focused on voice gender detection.
**Introduction**
Voice gender detection is the process of automatically identifying the gender of speakers based on their recorded speech. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to classify voice recordings into male or female categories.
Dataset
The project utilizes the **Mozilla Common Voice dataset**, which contains a large collection of validated speech recordings with associated gender labels. The dataset is publicly available and can be accessed via **Kaggle**.
**Find the Dataset here:**
**Requirements:**

Python 3.x
NumPy
pandas
scikit-learn
TensorFlow
Keras
Librosa (for audio processing)
PyQt5 (for GUI development)

**Installation**
**Clone this repository to your local machine:**
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Tazeensk/ML-Tasks/tree/main.git
Install the required Python packages using pip:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage

**Data Preparation:**
Download the Mozilla Common Voice dataset from Kaggle and place it in the data directory.
Preprocess the dataset, including feature extraction from audio recordings.

**Model Training:**
Train machine learning or deep learning models using the preprocessed data.
Experiment with different algorithms and architectures to optimize performance.
GUI Development:

Utilize PyQt5 to develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for the voice gender detection system.
Integrate the trained model with the GUI to provide a user-friendly interface for gender classification.

**Deployment:**
Deploy the GUI application to provide a practical tool for voice gender detection tasks.
Directory Structure
**data**: Contains the dataset files.
**models:** Stores trained machine learning or deep learning models.
**src:** Contains source code files, including preprocessing scripts, model training scripts, and GUI development files.
